CutieHack 2021 Project

11/6/2021 

[Cutie Hack](https://www.cutiehack.io/) is an online 12 hour hackathon hosted by UCR. Our team consists of [Ann-Marina](https://github.com/limesoda314), [Ivan](https://github.com/ivanneto02), [Taneesha](https://github.com/taneesha7), and Cody.

Our project allows a user to draw a digit and the program will attempt to classify what the digit is. We are using python to create the classifier model. We use keras with tensorflow as a backend to create a Convolutional Neural Network that is trained on the MNIST dataset. From there we save the model and use QT as our user interface (UI).
